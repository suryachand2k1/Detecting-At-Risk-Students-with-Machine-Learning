# Project Title: Student Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description
This project aims to detect students at risk of withdrawing from courses using various machine learning algorithms. Utilizing datasets like OULAD, the system applies algorithms such as Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, Generalised Linear Model, and Feed Forward Neural Network. The project includes preprocessing steps, feature selection using PCA, and evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1 score, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converts non-numeric values to numeric and applies PCA for feature selection.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Includes Random Forest, MLP, Gradient Boosting, Generalised Linear Model, and Feed Forward Neural Network.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates models based on accuracy, F1 score, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.
- **Risk Prediction:** Predicts whether a student is likely to withdraw based on their past performance.
